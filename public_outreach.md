Throughout my grad school, I have actively taken part in promoting my research and science to general audience including high school kids. Rice University provides unique opportunities to cultivate your scientific communication skills and community outreach.

## Grad Student Show & Tell

The Rice Office of STEM Engagement coordinates a [semester-long program][grad-show-n-tell] designed for graduate students and postdocs at Rice University. The program pairs grad student and postdoc participants to create a school-level presentation about their research at Rice, their individual educational backgrounds, and what inspired their interest in graduate school. Each pair is matched to a Houston ISD teacher based on content and availability, with groups coordinating a day to present their work to students in the Fall 2016 semester.

Together with Jaehee Park (ECE PhD student) and Corey Fisher (CS PhD Student), I presented a talk to grade 7-9 students from Energy Institute High School, Houston. In this talk, we motivated the students by discussing how our research impacts the society and provided a glimpse of grad school life :v:

## SCREECH

[SCREECH][screech] is an opportunity for graduate students to deliver a 90-second snapshot of their research. Competing participants will highlight the objectives and impact of the diverse graduate research projects being done in Rice University’s School of Engineering. The event aims to connect cutting-edge research with a diverse audience to showcase the unconventional wisdom that exemplifies Rice. A panel of judges composed by members of academia and industry will select the winners.

I have presented twice in the SCREECH competition. In 2014, my 60 GHz research and in 2016, visible light communication research. During the 90 seconds, my goal is to provide a clear understanding of a potential scenario where my research would provide huge benefits!

## Li-Fi meets Wi-Fi at SCREECH 2016

Doctors nowadays use Wi-Fi to receive real-time critical messages about patient’s health conditions. However, hospitals have constant heavy Internet traffic and large metallic interfering equipment that can prevent real-time delivery of critical messages. What we do have is Light available everywhere! And this light has been shown to be capable of Gigabit rate communication. A light bulb’s intensity can change at a fast rate unnoticeable to the human eyes. At the same time, these changes can be picked up by low-cost sensors on your smartphones. To provide the best service from the light bulbs, a two-way communication needs to be maintained. Unfortunately, size and battery constraints of your smartphone prevents responding back using visible light. I have designed an integrated Visible Light-Wi-Fi technology that can offload critical messages over to visible light. Also, despite the heavy Internet traffic, this design enables the smartphones to provide near-instant short Wi-Fi responses to maintain connection. Doctors can soon rely on my technology to save time and also save patient lives.

## Multicasting over mm-Wave at SCREECH 2014

You are stuck at a crowded bus stop and are missing the live coverage of your favorite sports event. You try to stream it on your mobile but the video provided by Wi-Fi is nowhere close to the High Definition (HD) video we've become addicted to at our homes :tv: Luckily, an emerging technology called millimeter-wave communication can provide a very high signal quality that can solve our problem. Let's use it, right? Well, it's not all that rosy :confused: The millimeter-wave signal decreases 100 times faster than that of Wi-Fi. So, in order to achieve the desired quality, we have to focus the whole signal in high-directional beams instead of transmitting everywhere as Wi-Fi does. My work directly addresses this challenge. It generates optimal beams of highly variable sizes starting from a very thin beam for a faraway user to a wide beam for nearby and co-located users. Using this approach, the video reaches all the users quickly irrespective of the number of users requesting the video. This efficiency is completely lacking in current techniques. All of them use fixed beam sizes. Their inefficiency hijacks the resources of Twitter, Reddit etc. that one can run while watching the live video. Using my protocol, you can **seamlessly** run many applications while enjoying your live video of the highest possibly quality. Soon, you'll be able to really, like really multi-task :smile:
