**Areas of interest**
=======

Currently an active contributor to IEEE 802.11 standards development activities with particular focus on **IEEE 802.11be technologies: multi-channel/multi-band operation and multi-AP coordination**. My PhD research focused on designing cross-layer MAC-PHY algorithms for 60 GHz WLANs and joint Visible Light communication and RF WLANs. My Masters thesis focused on mobility management and service quality management of heterogeneous cellular networks.
