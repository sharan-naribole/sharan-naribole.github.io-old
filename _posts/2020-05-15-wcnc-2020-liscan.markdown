## Abstract

Contention-based uplink radio access might lead to significant degradation in airtime efficiency and 
energy efficiency as the time spent “awake” by the radio is dependent on the network traffic conditions. 
In this paper, we design and evaluate LiSCAN, a visible light uni-directional control channel for contention-free 
uplink radio access. LiSCAN enables a virtual full-duplex operation by broadcasting polling frames (light-polls) 
across distributed LED luminaires concurrently with data reception over radio. In LiSCAN, each client consists of 
an additional low-power light sensor, which upon hearing a light-poll directed to it by Access Point (AP), wakes 
up the radio module only if there is backlogged traffic. To maximize the airtime efficiency, LiSCAN transmits 
light-polls successively until it detects an uplink radio transmission. LiSCAN’s pipelined polling enables clients 
to detect failure in uplink packet reception and accordingly abort their transmissions to eliminate collisions at the AP.
We simulate LiSCAN and alternate strategies in ns-3 network simulator to analyze LiSCAN’s performance under varying 
traffic conditions. Our results show that LiSCAN can provide significant improvements in the radio airtime efficiency, 
the sessions delivered with pre-defined service quality requirements and energy savings.
