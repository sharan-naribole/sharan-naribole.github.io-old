## Abstract

The next-generation IEEE 802.11 standard project, IEEE 802.11be, is focused to meet the growing demands 
of applications including high throughput, low latency and high reliability. With the emergence of dual-radio 
end user devices (STAs) and tri-band Access Points (APs), efficient operation over multiple channels distributed 
over multiple bands is a key technology being discussed in IEEE 802.11be task group to achieve the desired objectives. 
Due to insufficient channel separation in frequency, STAs might be unable to perform simultaneous transmit and receive
operations over the multiple channels in an asynchronous manner. To maximize the medium utilization of such constrained 
STAs participating in asynchronous multi-channel operation, we design and analyze Constraint Aware Asynchronous multi-channel 
operation (CA-ASYNC) protocol that includes an opportunistic 802.11 backoff resumption technique applied by the constrained 
STAs and multichannel busy state indication by the AP to the constrained STAs. Our results show that (a) CA-ASYNCâ€™s 
opportunistic backoff resumption technique significantly improves the medium utilization for constrained STAs compared 
to alternative strategies and (b) the multi-channel busy status indication significantly decreases the collisions due 
to constrained STAs and improves access delay performance.
