Hi, welcome to my personal website. I am currently working as a Senior Software Engineer with the US Connectivity and Wi-Fi Systems Group, Samsung Semiconductor, Inc. in San Jose, California. My work broadly involves protocol design for wireless communications in the unlicensed spectrum, implementation and evaluation of protocols and latest 802.11 standards features in our custom network simulation platform, and participation in 802.11 standards activities.

I received by doctoral degree in Electrical & Computer Engineering from Rice University in May 2018. I was a member of the [Rice Networks Group][rng] and my PhD advisor is [Edward Knightly][knightly]. My PhD research broadly focused on designing networking algorithms for next-generation wireless technologies including millimeter-wave (60 GHz) communication and visible light communication. Data scientist, for me, is the perfect amalgamation of intellectual curiosity, programming skills and communication skills. In each of the above skills, I have gained strong experience through cutting-edge research projects with international peer-reviewed publications and public speaking about my research in competitions.

According to Eric Schmidt, former CEO of Google, every two days humans create as much data as all of humanity before 2003. I am inspired by how this sudden surge of data is driving the key decisions made by corporations as well as governments. In December 2016, I became a remote [Data Science Fellow at NYC Data Science Academy][nyc-dsa-profile]. This opportunity helped me work on independent data science projects using state-of-the-art tools in R and Python. A key highlight is the H-1B Visa dataset that I curated from raw data now available publicly on Kaggle.

In this site, you can find me blogging on my grad school research, data science projects, internships, etc. :v:
