My name is Sharan Naribole and I am currently a PhD student at Rice University in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering. I am a member of the [Rice Networks Group][rng] and my advisor is [Edward Knightly][knightly]. My research broadly focuses on designing protocols for next-generation Wireless Networks including millimeter-wave (60 GHz) communication and visible light communication. **I cleared my PhD Proposal in November 2016 and aim to graduate September - December 2017.** :hourglass:

**I am highly interested in pursuing a Data Science career after PhD.** I am currently a remote Data Science Fellow (part-time) at NYC Data Science Academy (Dec 2016 - April 2017).

In this site, you can find me blogging on my grad school research, data science projects, internships, etc. :v:
