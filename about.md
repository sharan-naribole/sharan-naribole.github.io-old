Hi, welcome to my personal website. I am currently working as a Senior Software Engineer with the US Connectivity and Wi-Fi Systems Group, Samsung Semiconductor, Inc. in San Jose, California. My work broadly involves protocol design for wireless communications in the unlicensed spectrum, implementation and evaluation of protocols and latest 802.11 standards features in our custom network simulation platform, and participation in 802.11 standards activities.

I received by doctoral degree in Electrical & Computer Engineering from Rice University in May 2018. I was a member of the [Rice Networks Group][rng] and my PhD advisor is [Edward Knightly][knightly]. My PhD research broadly focused on designing networking algorithms for next-generation wireless technologies including millimeter-wave (60 GHz) communication and visible light communication.
